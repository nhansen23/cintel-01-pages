# My Website

My first website using Markdown and GitHub Pages.

## Links

Here's a clickable link: [My favorite AI assistant](https://www.bing.com/chat)

## Images

Images look like links except with an exclamation directly in front

## Reminders

Use a dash space for unordered lists

- Spaces matter

- Spelling matters

- Capitalization matters
